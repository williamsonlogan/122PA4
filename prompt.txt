The general program flow is as follows:
Generate a random number between 1 – 5 and 3 – 8 for express and normal lanes, respectively. This represents the arrival time of the first customer into each lane.
Set the variable for total time elapsed to 0.
As customers arrive into each line, randomly generate a service time for each. Start processing the customers in the lanes based on service time.
Randomly generate the arrival time of the next customer into each line. Elapsed time should be updated by one unit.
As each minute elapses, a new customer may arrive and/or another customer may be done checking out. Display the appropriate messages as described above.
For every 10 minutes, print out the entire queue for each line
Repeat steps 2 through 4 for n minutes of simulation.


This assignment is worth 100 points. Your assignment will be evaluated based on a successful compilation and adherence to the program requirements.
We will grade according to the following criteria:

*       10 pts – Appropriate top-down design, style, and commenting according to class standards
*       25 pts – Correct usages of two queues in simulation
*       5 pts – Correct QueueNode definition
*       5 pts – Correct Queue definition
*       10 pts – Correct makeNode()
*       10 pts – Correct printQueue()
*       5 pts – Correct isEmpty()
*       15 pts – Correct enqueue()
*       15 pts – Correct dequeue()

*       BONUS: Up to 20 pts for implementation of grocery item list/customer
